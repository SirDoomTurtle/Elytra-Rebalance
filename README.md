# Elytra Rebalance
My first attempt at a Minecraft mod for 1.21 [Fabric]. 

This mod allows users to set a speed multiplier for the elytra and set a different maximum durability for the elytra.

The mod sets the speed multiplier to 0.8 and the durabilty to 800 by default.
If you want vanilla behavior, you can set the speed to 1.0 and the durability to 432.

The speed of the elytra is modified whenever players fly in a "horizontal-ish" direction. This means that if players dive-bomb straight down, they will still be able to fly fast and dynamically, but once they pull out of the dive, the speed modifier is applied.

The main purpose of this mod is for use on Servers. It should "nerf" the elytra to make other forms of transport more viable, and it has the nice side effect of benefiting server performance, because players will not be able to fly as fast into unloaded chunks.
